# PLAN
- peekFirst()
- peekLast()
- size()
- isEmpty()
- addFirst()
- addLast()
- removeFirst()
- removeLast()
- getFirst()
- getLast()
- pollFirst()
- pollLast()
- offerFirst()
- offerLast()

We chose to do the peek() methods first because they're the least intrusive by not changing the data structure, which makes them easier to create. size() and isEmpty() have similar implementations. The rest are equally difficult.
