HW82 -- Roll Your Own Iterator
2022-03-27
time spent: 00.8 hrs

DISCO:
- Instead of returning _dummy.getNext().getCargo() in the next() method, first set _dummy to _dummy.getNext() so the pointer is accurately representing where we are iterating from.

QCC:
- Are we supposed to create a new LList in class MyIterator for the constructor and new methods? or would it just be using _dummy and DLLNode's methods?
- Why isn't the first node of the list printing?
