0. The number of digits in a number system, the largest digit would be x-1, where x is the base number.
1. Binary uses the base-2 number system. This is important because it simplifies choices into only two options.
2. 0. Count how many digits are in the binary number. Let x represent the number of digits.
    1. Label the digits from left to right, starting with 2^(x-1) and descend until no digits are left.
    2. Add the corresponding label for each digit that is 1. Ignore the labels for digits that are 0.
3. 0. Take the decimal number, divide it by 2, and store the remainder on the side. Write the quotient underneath.
    1. Repeat step 0 until you reach a quotient of 1.
    2. Take the
