0. The number of digits in a number system, the largest digit would be x-1, where x is the base number.
1. Binary uses the base-2 number system. This is important because it simplifies choices into only two options, increasing efficiency in computing.
2. 0. Count how many digits are in the binary number. Let x represent the number of digits.
    1. Label the digits from left to right, starting with 2^(x-1) and descend until you reach 2^0 and no digits are left.
    2. Add the corresponding label for each digit that is 1. Ignore the labels for digits that are 0.
    **For 1 digits in the binary number, sum the values of their corresponding labels (maybe this is clearer?)
3. 0. Take the decimal number, divide it by 2, and write the whole number quotient underneath. Store the remainder to the side.
    1. Repeat step 0 until you reach a quotient of 1.
    2. Read the remainders from bottom to top to obtain the binary number.
