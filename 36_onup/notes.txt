Types of Errors:
    - compile-time errors: syntax is wrong
    - run-time errors: something goes wrong while program runs
    - logic errors: program does wrong thing

Compile-Time Errors:
    - compiler has error messages
        - only first error message is reliable
        - fix one error at a time
    - weird compiler message
        - read message and go to location of error
            - error is probably prior to location
            - if error is not found, look at entire program and check for syntax errors
    - program does not compile
        - check to make sure it's the right program, not a different copy of the same program
        - put obvious syntax error -> compile
            - if error doesn't show up, set up of development environment is wrong
        - if program is the right one, debug by bisection
            - make backup of file
            - delete half of code -> compile
                - compiles: error is in deleted code, repeat by replacing code with deleted portion
                - doesn't compile: error is in code left, delete half and repeat
    - did what the compiler said, doesn't work
        - don't always follow what compiler suggests, solution may be simpler

Run-Time Errors:
    - program hangs (stopping and not doing anything)
        - if it's a specific loop, add print statements indicating beginning and end of loop
            - if second message is not printed, it is an infinite loop
                - add print statements displaying values of variables and value of boolean of loop
                    - 3 lines should output for every loop (if there are 2 variables)
                        - last time should print false for conditional
        - infinte recursion will make loop run for a little, then output StackOverflowError
            - check for a base case in the method
            - if there isn't a base case, but program isn't reaching it, add print statement at beginning of method for parameters
        - check flow of execution
            - add print statements to beginning of methods to trace
    - geting an exception
        - NullPointerException: accessing instance variable or invoking method on object that is Null
        - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: index of array is negative or greater than array.length-1
        - StackOverflowError
        - FIleNotFoundException: Java can't find the file it was looking for
        - ArithmeticException: arithmetic went wrong
    - too many outputs because of print statements
        - simplify output: remove or combine print statements
        - simplify program: scale down problem, clean up code

Logic Errors:
    - program doesn't work
        - hypothesize what the program is doing vs what it's supposed to do
        - create a mental model by breaking down the program (usually into classes and methods)
    - long expression doesn't work
        - break down using temp variables and assigning them to expressions in the original expression
        - check the order of operations
    - method not returning expected output
        - rewrite long expression with temp variables
            - return values of temp variables before returning main expression to check
    - print statement not doing anything
        - using print (instead of println) will store output but not display it until next newline
            - change print -> println
    - stuck
        - go away from computer for a bit to calm down
            - when calm, think about possible errors in program
        - ask someone to look at it
            - be able to describe the program and problem well + tried solutions
            - basically the rubber ducking method
    - found bug
        - take time to understand algorithm and how to prevent bug in future
